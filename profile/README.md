# Welcome to scout-ch!

You found the Github organization of the [Swiss Guide and Scout Movement](https://pfadi.swiss)!

## What is scout-ch?
scout-ch is a collection of open-source projects and tools that are used by the Swiss Guide and Scout Movement. The projects are used to support the activities of scouts across Switzerland. Some are developed and maintained by volunteers from the movement and others are maintained by external providers. Therefore some projects are to be considered community projects, while others are actively maintained by the Swiss Guide and Scout Movement.

## How to contribute

Feel free to fork any repository you find here and create a pull request. We are happy to accept contributions from anyone who wants to help out. If you want to contribute to a specific project, please check the project's README file for contribution guidelines.

If you have a cool project or idea that you would like to share with the community, please contact us at itkom@pbs.ch. We are always looking for new contributors and projects to support the movement.
